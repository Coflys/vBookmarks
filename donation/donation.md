# WHY DONATE?

Maintaining my projects isn't effortless. It's been a long time since I started this project. It's getting harder and harder to spend enough time on it in recent years. Maybe some income from the project will encourage me to keep development. But ads showing in popup is not an option. So I made this donation page. If you think my project can help you and you'd like to use it in future, please consider to donate.

Sometimes a glass of beer or a cup of coffee can make me keep goging.
