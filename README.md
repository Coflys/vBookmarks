vBookmarks
==============

Modified from Neat Bookmarks extension for Google Chrome. 

The Bookmark Star in Chrome is an awful way to add a bookmark, and what I need is a extension just like "AddBookmarkHere" for Firefox.
So I enhance the features of "Neat Bookmarks", it's easy to add or remove bookmarks now.

1) Bookmark current tab before selected bookmark.

2) Bookmark current tab after selected bookmark.

3) Bookmark current tab to the top of selected folder.

4) Bookmark current tab to the bottom of selected folder.

5) Add a sub-folder into selected folder.

6) Update URL of bookmark with current URL.

7) Copy title and URL information for bookmarks to clipboard.

8) Fix bugs in Neat Bookmarks.
