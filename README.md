vBookmarks
==============

Modified from NeatBookmarks, an excellent bookmark extension for Google Chrome. 

Clicking the Bookmark Star in Chrome is an awful way to add a bookmark, and what I need is an extension just like "AddBookmarkHere" for Firefox.
So I added some new features to "NeatBookmarks", it's easy to manage your bookmarks now.

1) Bookmark current tab before selected bookmark/folder.

2) Bookmark current tab after selected bookmark/folder.

3) Bookmark current tab to the top of selected folder.

4) Bookmark current tab to the bottom of selected folder.

5) Add a sub-folder into selected folder.

6) Update URL of selected bookmark with current URL.

7) Copy title and URL information for selected bookmarks into clipboard.

8) Add an option: only show the nodes of the Bookmark Bar.

9) Fix bugs in Neat Bookmarks.
